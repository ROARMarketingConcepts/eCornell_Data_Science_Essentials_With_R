Use these libraries and this data set to answer the question below.

```{r, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(ellipsis)
expenditures <- read.csv("state_highway_expenditures.csv")
fatalities <- read.csv("state_highway_fatalities.csv")
```

*CQ1:*
The "expenditures" data set has information on the highway expenditures for various states in the U.S. Likewise, the "fatalities" data set has information on the highway fatalities for various states in the U.S. Examine these two data sets, then join them to create a single data set that gives the highway expenditures *and* fatalities for each state. Be sure to include *all states* in the new data set. Save your new data set as CQ1. 

```{r, include=FALSE}
CQ1 <- right_join(x=expenditures,y=fatalities,by='State')
```
