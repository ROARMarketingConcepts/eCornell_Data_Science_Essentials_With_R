Use these libraries and the storms data set, as modified below, as a starting point for the following question:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(ellipsis)
library(utf8)
storms <- read.csv("storms.csv")
storms$Category <- factor(storms$Category, levels = -1:5) # set the storm category to be a factor
storms$Date <- factor(storms$Date, levels = unique(storms$Date)) # set the measurement date/time to be a factor
sandy <- storms %>% filter(Name == "Sandy")
```

*CQ1:*
The following code creates a line plot displaying how Sandy's air pressure changed over time. Alter the code below to rotate the x-axis labels so they're readable.
```{r, echo=FALSE}
CQ1<- ggplot(sandy, aes(x = Date, y = Pressure, group = 1)) + 
  geom_line()+theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))
CQ1
```
